# EU Privacy- and human rights-related legislation: Foundations and present

## European Convention on Human Rights (1953)

<br />

-   Issued by the Council of Europe (founded 1949)

-   Legal institution: European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR, Strasbourg).

<br />

::: {style="font-size: 60%"}
**Article 8 -- Right to respect for private and family life**

*Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.*

*There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.*
:::

## Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2009)

-   Effective as of entry into force of Treaty of Lisbon (2009)

-   Enforced by: Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU, Luxembourg)

::: {style="font-size: 60%"}
**Article 7 - Respect for private and family life**\
Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.

**Article 8 - Protection of personal data**

1.  Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.

2.  Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.

3.  Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
:::

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2018)

-   applies whenever *personal* data are collected, used, or stored

-   rights:

    -   absolute: to be informed, to access, to rectification, to data portability

    -   restricted: to erasure, to restrict processing, to object

-   roles: controller, joint controller, processor

## GDPR & AI: Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

A *Privacy Impact Assessment* must always be conducted when the processing could result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. E.g.

-   scoring/profiling,

-   automatic decisions which lead to legal consequences for those impacted,

-   systematic monitoring,

-   processing of *special* personal data,

-   the merging or combining of data which was gathered by various processes,

-   data transfer to countries outside the EU/EEC

# EU Privacy- and human rights-related legislation: Drafts / Proposals (as per 12/2021)

## e-Privacy Directive (2002, amended 2009)

-   will be repealed by ePrivacy *Regulation* once that's been adopted

-   based on Article 16 and Article 114 of the *Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)*[^1], which lays out rules for the internal market. [^2]

-   rules on data retention, cookies, e-mail communication (among others)

-   criticized as [step back compared to the GDPR](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-03/edpb_statement_032021_eprivacy_regulation_en_0.pdf)

[^1]: The second of the two main treaties of the European Union, a continuation of the original Treaty of Rome (1958). The other is the treaty of Lisbon (2009), replacing the Treaty of Maastricht (1993).

[^2]: as well as Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights

::: notes
Directive vs. regulation: A regulation is immediately binding; each country has to adapt its laws to make them comply. A directive is individually implemented into national laws by each country so as to be at least minimally compliant.

Criticism:

-   broadly formulated exceptions to privacy of electronic communications data, including content, to "ensure network and end user device security"

<!-- -->

-   does not completely disallow cookie walls (exception: payment option given)

-   allows for further processing "for compatible purposes"
:::

## Data Governance Act (11/2020)

-   covers: re-use of public data; "data sharing services/intermediaries"; "data altruism"

-   where data includes *personal* data

-   *"*without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC"

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
"*Indeed, considering that data protection is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 8 of the Charter, and taking into account that one of the main purposes of the GDPR is to provide data subjects with control over personal data relating to them, the EDPB reiterates that personal data cannot be considered as a "tradeable commodity". An important consequence of this is that, even if the data subject can agree to the processing of his or her personal data, he or she cannot waive his or her fundamental rights."* [^3]

## Digital Services Act (12/2020)

-   defines a *layered* set of responsibilities for intermediaries (network infrastructure), hosting services, online platforms, and "very large online platforms"

-   Concerns:[^4]

    -   allows for use of AI systems categorizing individuals from biometrics according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation

    -   allows emotion recognition

    -   allows targeted advertising

[^4]: https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-11/edpb_statement_on_the_digital_services_package_and_data_strategy_en.pdf

## Digital Markets Act (12/2020)

-   sets up ex-ante rules for so-called *gatekeepers*, including

    -   to refrain from combining personal data from different sources

    -   to submit (on an annual basis) an independently audited description of any techniques deployed for profiling consumers

# The Proposed Artificial Intelligence Act

## Objectives

<br />

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
The general objective is to '*ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by creating the conditions for the development and use of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Union*' (impact assessment, p. 32).

The specific objectives are:

\(i\) to ensure that AI systems placed on the market and used are safe and respect *existing rules* on fundamental rights and Union values,

\(ii\) to ensure legal certainty to *facilitate investment and innovation* in AI,

\(iii\) to enhance governance and effective enforcement of *existing rules* on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems, and

\(iv\) to facilitate the *development of a single market* for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI applications and *prevent market fragmentation*. [^5]

## Approach {style="padding-bottom: 10%;"}

Risk-based:

-   Unacceptable risk: prohibited (absolutely or with exceptions)

-   High risk: catalog of requirements

-   Limited risk: transparency requirements

-   Low risk: tbd

## Unacceptable risk (1, prohibited): Manipulation (1)

<br />

::: {style="font-size: 100%;"}
The placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness [in order to]{style="color: red;"} materially distort a person's behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological [harm]{style="color:red;"}
:::

<br />

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
*"\[a\]n inaudible sound \[played\] in truck drivers' cabins to push them to drive longer than healthy and safe \[where\] AI is used to find the frequency maximising this effect on drivers"*
:::

<br />

## Unacceptable risk (1, prohibited): Manipulation (2)

<br />

::: {style="font-size: 100%;"}
The placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons due to their age, physical or mental disability, [in order to]{style="color:red"} materially distort the behaviour of a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological [harm]{style="color:red"}
:::

<br />

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
"\[a\] doll with integrated voice assistant \[which\] encourages a minor to engage in progressively dangerous behavior or challenges in the guise of a fun or cool game"
:::

## Unacceptable risk (1, prohibited): Problems

<br >

-   [Harm]{style="color:red"}: does not consider cumulative harm

-   [Intent]{style="color:red"}:

    -   hard to prove

    -    does not consider *dual use*

    -   does not consider the usual newspeak / marketing strategies

    -   leaves out dynamics in the user base

-   Does not add much to existing EU law (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive)

## Unacceptable risk (2, prohibited): Social Scoring
